# Employee Attrition and Department Prediction Model

## Background

In this project, we aim to develop a neural network model to assist HR in two key tasks:
1. **Predicting Employee Attrition**: We will predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as job satisfaction, work performance, tenure, and others. This prediction will help HR departments proactively address potential attrition and improve employee retention strategies.
  
2. **Predicting Optimal Department**: HR believes that some employees may be better suited to different departments within the company. Therefore, the second task is to predict the department that best fits each employee. This model will help HR make more informed decisions about internal mobility, enhancing employee satisfaction and organizational efficiency.

To achieve this, we will employ a **branched neural network**. The branched architecture allows the model to make two distinct predictions:
- One for employee attrition (binary classification: "leave" or "stay").
- One for department assignment (multi-class classification).

Both outputs are crucial to HR's decision-making process, and by combining them in a single model, we aim to improve operational efficiency.

## Model Overview

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset used for training this model includes various employee features, such as:
- **Personal Information**: Age, gender, marital status, etc.
- **Job-Related Data**: Job satisfaction, tenure, job role, performance metrics, etc.
- **Employee Engagement**: Work-life balance, company culture feedback, etc.
- **Other Relevant Attributes**: Compensation, previous job history, etc.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the following preprocessing steps were carried out:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation or removal of missing values based on the nature of the column.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical features (e.g., department, job role) were converted into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Normalization**: Continuous numerical features were normalized to ensure the neural network could learn effectively, especially when dealing with varying ranges.

### 3. Model Architecture
The model consists of a **branched neural network** architecture with two distinct outputs:
- **Attrition Output**: This output uses a sigmoid activation function to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (binary classification: "Yes" or "No").
- **Department Output**: This output uses a softmax activation function to predict the most suitable department for the employee (multi-class classification, where each department is represented as a class).

The model is structured as follows:
- **Input Layer**: Takes in all relevant employee features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Consists of fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activation to learn complex patterns.
- **Branch 1 (Attrition Prediction)**: A sigmoid output layer for binary classification.
- **Branch 2 (Department Prediction)**: A softmax output layer for multi-class classification.

Both outputs are trained simultaneously using a multi-task loss function, where the total loss is the sum of the losses from both branches.

### 4. Model Training
The model was trained using a standard optimization technique, with the following considerations:
- **Loss Functions**:
  - Binary cross-entropy for attrition prediction.
  - Categorical cross-entropy for department prediction.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency and adaptability in training deep learning models.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy for both tasks, but additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score should be considered for evaluating performance in a real-world scenario, especially for class imbalances.

## Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using various metrics to understand its performance:
- **Attrition Prediction**:
  - Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score: These metrics provide more insights, especially in cases of class imbalance where predicting attrition ("Yes") may be rare.
  
- **Department Prediction**:
  - Accuracy: Measures the proportion of employees correctly assigned to their predicted department.
  - Other metrics like confusion matrices and precision/recall for each class (department) can also provide deeper insights.

### Challenges
- **Class Imbalance**: Attrition prediction can often suffer from class imbalance, where fewer employees leave the company than stay. This issue can be mitigated using techniques like class weighting, oversampling, or undersampling.
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing the right features that influence both attrition and departmental fit is crucial for improving model performance.

## Model Improvements

While the current model provides a strong baseline, there are several ways it could be improved:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can further improve model performance.
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining this model with other models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) can improve robustness.
3. **Data Augmentation**: If data is scarce, techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can help create synthetic samples, particularly for the underrepresented class in attrition predictions.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporating more granular features, like employee engagement scores or feedback, could improve predictions.

## Conclusion

This project provides HR with a powerful tool to predict employee attrition and recommend optimal departments for employees. By using a branched neural network architecture, the model performs both tasks simultaneously, enhancing HR's decision-making process and operational efficiency.

Future iterations of the model could focus on fine-tuning, improving data quality, and exploring other machine learning models to increase the overall accuracy and effectiveness of these predictions.
